# Star Wars RPG
A fun, interactive jQuery game.

# Usage
As players visit the site, they are given a choice of characters to pick from. Each character has HP (user facing) and attack and counterattack stats (non-user facing). Once the player character is selected they must select their foe, with the goal of defeating all enemies to win.

Every time the player attacks their attack stat increases by their base stat, 2 becomes 4 then 6 and so on. Their foe's counteract stat stays the same, though is markedly more powerful than the player's attack stat. Picking the right order, as well as a little trial and error, are the keys to success.
